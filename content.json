Instant Withdrawal** \nInstant withdrawal allows you to get access to your liquidity immediately but requires to forfeit a specific amount of the capital. That amount is determined at the moment of withdrawal and depends on the amount of senior gains in the pool that have to be covered by pooled junior deposits. \n\n**2. 2-step Withdrawal** \n2-step withdrawal allows the withdrawal of the full amount of liquidity but in the future. \n\nThe first step is issuing a junior bond with parameters including the withdrawal amount and a maturity date (which is calculated at the time of the bond minting and depends on the avg. senior maturity). \n\nThe second step is redeeming the junior bond at maturity. \n\n‚ÑπÔ∏è [How to withdraw junior tokens?](https://docs.barnbridge.com/how-to-guides/smart-yield/how-to-withdraw-junior-tokens)"
