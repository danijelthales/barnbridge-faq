Instant Withdrawal** \nThe sellTokens() function allows juniors to instantly withdraw their unlocked underlying tokens. The locked part of each jToken is burnt in favor of the existing jToken holders, increasing the price. Effectively using this function, a junior forfeits their locked underlying. This allows instant arbitrage opportunities between our pool and secondary markets where jTokens are traded, like Uniswap, creating a floor for the jToken price. \n\n**2. 2-step Withdrawal** \nThe 2-step process allows a user to first signal the intention of exiting the pool. In return they receive an NFT that can be redeemed after the current ABOND ends. The first transaction after ABOND.maturesAt triggers the liquidation for all jTokens scheduled for liquidation. The user can come anytime after ABOND.maturesAt to withdraw their part of the liquidation. \na) Signal withdrawal = buy junior bond NFT \nb) Redeem junior bond NFT \n\nAll jTokens locked in junior Bond NFTs after the 1st step are excluded from the junior pool when calculating new senior BOND rates, so these funds are not used to collateralize any further senior positions, but they will be subject to the profit and losses of the pool until the maturity date of the aggregate bond - in order to continue to guarantee the yields for the senior positions that were opened during their lifetime. \n\nEach 2 step withdraw initiation will create a jBOND NFT with a maturity date for the second step. The second and final step of withdrawal, can be called publicly by anyone and it will burn the NFT and send the owed tokens to the NFT's owner. \n\nCheck our detailed guide here: [How to withdraw junior tokens?](https://docs.barnbridge.com/smart-yield/how-to-withdraw-junior-tokens)"
