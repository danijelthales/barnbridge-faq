      "value": "USDC/DAI/sUSD yield farming pool was launched on Oct 19th, 2020. This staking contract was the first mechanism delivering initial $BOND token distribution to the community. This contract holds 8% of the total supply and will be distributed to community members who stake DAI, USDC, & sUSD. \n\nStablecoins are equally rewarded. 1 USDC = 1 DAI = 1 sUSD. \n\nRead more about the pool in this Medium post: [Yield Farming and LP Incentivization.](https://medium.com/barnbridge/yield-farming-and-lp-incentivization-25eba3f55ec4)"
