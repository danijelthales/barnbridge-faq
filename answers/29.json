      "value": "Yield Farming is the first mechanism delivering initial $BOND token distribution to the community. This contract holds 8% of the total supply (800,000 $BOND tokens) and is being distributed to community members who stake DAI, USDC, & sUSD during the period of 25 weeks. \n \nPhase two is the Liquidity Mining Incentivization Program. This initiative is granted 20% of the total supply (2,000,000 $BOND tokens) and each epoch has 20,000 $BOND tokens. This will last 100 weeks."
