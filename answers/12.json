      "value": "LaunchDAO is a temporary DAO consisting of the project founders, seeders and advisors for building the initial version of the protocol. LaunchDAO uses $BBVOTE token. \n\nBarnBridgeDAO is going to be the final DAO where the community can vote with their $BOND tokens. The BarnBridge DAO will become the core component of the BarnBridge platform as it enables decentralized decision making to enforce actions in the interest of the community."
