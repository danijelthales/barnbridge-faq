      "value": "You most likely staked $BOND tokens after the proposal was created. Proposals take a snapshot of user balances at the block they are created. It is designed this way to prevent double voting - if someone votes using one wallet address, then sends to another wallet address and votes again. By taking the snapshot at a block creation, the second address would register as having 0 voting power, which prevents the fraud."
