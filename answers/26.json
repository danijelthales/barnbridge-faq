      "value": "Senior and junior tranches will be available in our main products - SMART Yield Bond & SMART Alpha. Senior tranches are less risky and guarantee yield with the fixed interest. Junior tranches are liquidity providers to senior tranches, so if there isnâ€™t enough yield - they lose first and cover the losses of seniors if needed. At the same time, juniors take more profit in case the yield was high."
