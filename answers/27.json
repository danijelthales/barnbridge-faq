      "value": "BarnBridge Uniswap fees are not automatically distributed. They are added to the pool, so when you burn your LP tokens and withdraw your liquidity from the pool, you’ll also get the fees. The staking contract does not collect any fees and neither is BarnBridge. You can read more here: [https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/advanced-topics/fees/](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/advanced-topics/fees/). Check out the first paragraph - “Liquidity provider fees”."
