      "value": "If you withdraw before the epoch ends, there are 2 possibilities: \n1. You withdraw the full amount => in which case your effective balance goes to 0 because your actual balance, which is now 0, multiplied by any kind of multiplier is still 0. \nYou withdraw only a part of it => the multiplier is recalculated as the weighted average of the deposits (let’s say you deposit 100 DAI then after half of the time you withdraw 50 DAI => you’ll end up just like you initially deposited 50 DAI). \n\nAny withdrawal causes the reward for the amount of money withdrawn to be lost."
