      "value": "The deposit works like this: for the current epoch, the amount that is taken into consideration when the reward is calculated is relative to the time when you deposited. \n\nIf you enter when thereâ€™s only 20% time left, your effective balance will be equal to actual balance * 20% where the multiplier is exactly that 20%. For the next epoch (and any subsequent epoch), the multiplier is set back to 100%. \n\nIf you deposit some more, the multiplier will be less, but the effective balance will always be greater than the previous. For example: you start the epoch with 100 DAI, then deposit 100 DAI at exactly 50% of the epoch => your effective balance for this epoch is 150 DAI = 100 + 50% * 100 or 200*75% - 75% being the new weighted-average multiplier."
