      "value": "The Founders, Seeders, and Advisors are using an Aragon DAO Company Template which uses transferable tokens to represent ownership stake. Decisions are made based on stake-weighted voting with the $BBVOTE token. \n\nThe Founders received 45%, Seeders received 45%, and Advisors got 10%. The minimum voting support is set to 62%, meaning for a proposal to be passed it must be approved by at least 62%. \n\nThe funds from the seeders and the initial supply of the $BOND token will be kept in the Launch DAO treasury. You can find the LaunchDAO [here](https://client.aragon.org/#/barnbridgelaunch/)."
